        How a small yet feisty little girl overcame the impossible from a rough
        neighbourhood to a relaxed lifestyle in Lower Templestowe with frequent
        cuddles and lots of food.

      <div class="list">
        <ul>
          <li>Nyx was born in 2016 in Broadmeadows</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            She grew up in a household with lots of possums and started
            developing grey hair early on from stress
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In 2018 she met a male pomeranian they had a litter with 4 puppies
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Within 6 months all of Nyx's puppies were sold off and taken away
            from her. She was devastated for a minute, before she realised she
            had more food for herself
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Her owners then sold her off into the circus because she had
            excellent balancing and pouncing skills
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Nyx enjoyed doing tricks but realised she wasn't getting enough food
            for all the pouncing she was doing. She decided to run away
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            She returned to Broady to try and find her puppies again. She looked
            high and low but had no luck
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            She was captured one day by the Lost Dogs Home. The new environment
            was very scary and filled with barking dogs
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            They operated on her and Nyxy was hurting for weeks afterwards
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On September 3rd 2019 she met Vicky and Maree and charmed them
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On September 5th, they decided to adopt Nyxy and bring her back to
            leafy Lower Templestowe
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            To this day Nyxy enjoys plenty of treats, MyDog dinners and cuddles
          </li>
